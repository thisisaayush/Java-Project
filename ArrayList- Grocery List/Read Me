In this project, we have used the concept of dynamic array- arraylist- and had used it to create a grocery list which has features like 
addItems, printGroceryItems, modifyGroceryItems, removeGroceryItems, and searchItems in a grocerry list. It gives the idea of how general 
online line shopping applications works internally.
